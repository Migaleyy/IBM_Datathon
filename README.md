# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Skin cancer detection

# SOLUTION :
To solve the problem of melanoma detection, I plan to develop a machine learning model, specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
to analyze dermoscopic images for early and accurate melanoma identification. The project involves collecting and preprocessing image data, training the CNN model, 
and deploying it in a user-friendly web or mobile application. This automated system aims to assist dermatologists by improving diagnostic accuracy and speeding up the detection process.
